<h2>Reference</h2>

- This project is inspired by one of the <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges">Frontend Mentor Challenges</a>. I started off by completing that challenge first (<a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/url-shortening-api-landing-page-using-html-css-javascript-W8KO3Lrg8E">Check it out</a>).
- As I progressed with the challenge I kept on marking all the features I wanted to add or change for my take on the project.
- I started by changing the color scheme of the website. After playing around with multiple colors I stuck to blues-pinks-grays.
- I also wanted to try some fun hover effects, so I did some research over multiple platforms and the 'underline on hover' effect attracted me the most for this website.
- As for the images and patterns, I took the help of <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> and created images with the perfect color scheme for my website.

<h2>Things I Learnt</h2>

- I got to learn about the local storage feature (browser).
- The importance of different fonts and their impacts.
- Color schemes can change the feel of any website.
- Subtle changes can add much value to any website.
